		[00:00.176] Follow me
        [00:02.606] Follow me now once more into the breach
        [00:09.300] Can you see?
        [00:11.487] Can you see how this is the way to destiny?
        [00:36.504] Am I alive?
        [00:40.764] Am I pretending?
        [00:45.138] You said I could fly
        [00:48.963] So go on, then
        [00:53.339] Fill my eyes with fire
        [00:57.766] I’m a sleeper awakened
        [01:02.275] I set my sails with desire
        [01:06.555] And drift to the edge where the fate ends
        [01:10.806] Where fate ends
        [01:12.776] Follow me
        [01:14.884] Follow me now once more into the breach
        [01:21.675] Can you see?
        [01:23.944] Can you see how this is the way to destiny?
        [01:30.594] Crystalized
        [01:33.909] Under the weight of the nothingness
        [01:39.723] Crucified
        [01:43.149] By the end
        [01:46.579] I am losing the way I want to be
        [01:51.476] But we wander the wilderness in violence
        [01:57.680] I just want to be home with the light again
        [02:04.423] Take me home
        [02:07.019] Follow me
        [02:09.254] Follow me now once more into the breach
        [02:15.977] Can you see?
        [02:18.218] Can you see how this is the way to destiny?
        [02:24.947] Follow me
        [02:27.356] Follow me now once more into the breach
        [02:34.146] Can you see?
        [02:36.378] Can you see how this is the way to destiny?
        [03:21.554] Follow me
        [03:23.973] Follow me now once more into the breach
        [03:30.768] Can you see?
        [03:32.983] Can you see how this is the way to destiny?
        [03:39.925] Follow me
        [03:42.034] Follow me now once more into the breach
        [03:48.935] Can you see?
        [03:51.059] Can you see how this is the way to destiny?

## 歌词
[主歌 1]
Tired eyes, barely open
Crippled by a promise broken
I have seen an empire falling
Hopeless, can you hear me calling?

[过渡副歌]
Turn away from all that I know
Burning this bridge behind me
Light the way and I'll follow
Where you go

[副歌]
Can you tell me what is real?
Cause I've lost my way again
Can you tell me how to feel?
Cause I don't feel anything
Now that I'm down here again
I'm down with the fallen again

[合唱 2]
Searching through the darkness below
For a light in seas of shadows
Far from you, but I could never
Abdicate, I'll fight forever

[过渡副歌]
Turn away from all that I know
Burning this bridge behind me
Light the way and I'll follow
Where you go

[副歌]
Can you tell me what is real?
Cause I've lost my way again
Can you tell me how to feel?
Cause I don't feel anything
Now that I'm down here again
I'm down with the fallen again

[间奏]
I will not run
I will not fall
I will not bury it
This is war!
Breaking through the barricade
War!
Unafraid of what's to come now
This is war!
Fight the fear that I evade
War!
Can you hear me calling

[副歌 2]
Tell me what is real?
Cause I've lost my way again
Can you tell me how to feel?
Cause I don't feel anything
Now that I'm down here (again)
Tell me what is real?
Cause I've lost my way again
Can you tell me how to feel?
Cause I don't feel anything
Now that I'm down here (again)
I'm down with the fallen again

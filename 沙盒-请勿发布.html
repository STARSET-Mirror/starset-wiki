[00:00.176] Follow me<br>
[00:02.606] Follow me now once more into the breach<br>
[00:09.300] Can you see?<br>
[00:11.487] Can you see how this is the way to destiny?<br>
[00:36.504] Am I alive?<br>
[00:40.764] Am I pretending?<br>
[00:45.138] You said I could fly<br>
[00:48.963] So go on, then<br>
[00:53.339] Fill my eyes with fire<br>
[00:57.766] I’m a sleeper awakened<br>
[01:02.275] I set my sails with desire<br>
[01:06.555] And drift to the edge where the fate ends<br>
[01:10.806] Where fate ends<br>
[01:12.776] Follow me<br>
[01:14.884] Follow me now once more into the breach<br>
[01:21.675] Can you see?<br>
[01:23.944] Can you see how this is the way to destiny?<br>
[01:30.594] Crystalized<br>
[01:33.909] Under the weight of the nothingness<br>
[01:39.723] Crucified<br>
[01:43.149] By the end<br>
[01:46.579] I am losing the way I want to be<br>
[01:51.476] But we wander the wilderness in violence<br>
[01:57.680] I just want to be home with the light again<br>
[02:04.423] Take me home<br>
[02:07.019] Follow me<br>
[02:09.254] Follow me now once more into the breach<br>
[02:15.977] Can you see?<br>
[02:18.218] Can you see how this is the way to destiny?<br>
[02:24.947] Follow me<br>
[02:27.356] Follow me now once more into the breach<br>
[02:34.146] Can you see?<br>
[02:36.378] Can you see how this is the way to destiny?<br>
[03:21.554] Follow me<br>
[03:23.973] Follow me now once more into the breach<br>
[03:30.768] Can you see?<br>
[03:32.983] Can you see how this is the way to destiny?<br>
[03:39.925] Follow me<br>
[03:42.034] Follow me now once more into the breach<br>
[03:48.935] Can you see?<br>
[03:51.059] Can you see how this is the way to destiny?<br>
